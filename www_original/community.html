              <p>CALL CENTERS CARE (CCC) represents the philanthropic initiatives organized by the American Teleservices Association (ATA) and was originated by the Arizona Chapter, largely through the involvement of Synergy Solutions. This initiative was adopted by the ATA to unite members of the call center industry, on a national level, to make available various organized philanthropic efforts to further demonstrate that our industry contributes in a very personal way to local and national causes. Presently, twelve ATA local chapters are active contributors to various causes in their communities under the CALL CENTER CARES umbrella.</p>

<p>In addition to Call Centers Care activity on a local basis, nationally organized activities for the CCC include a coast to coast blood drive as well as Habitat for Humanity events that coincide with the ATA Annual Convention and Expo. </p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>  CALL CENTERS CARE – TEAM ARIZONA</strong></h2>
  <p>The Arizona Chapter of the ATA organized the CALL CENTERS CARE  team (CCC) in 2006 as a vehicle to conduct philanthropy in the community. <br />
    <br/>
    TEAM ARIZONA’s  initiatives are unprecedented in the history of the ATA. We have raised  thousands of dollars and turned the public eye to see the positive side of the  call center industry and our connection to our communities. It also is a  vehicle through which our employees can get involved and make a difference. The  team has created an emotional bond and positive connection among our employees,  our industry, and our community. TEAM ARIZONA  continues to focus on supporting needy organizations that are often  overshadowed by more highly publicized events. <br />
    <br/>
    In 2008, the CCC  – TEAM ARIZONA was the highest grossing fundraising team in our 5K Walk/Run to  support victims of domestic violence with over 120 representatives  participating in the philanthropic activity. This was TEAM ARIZONA’s third year  participating in the wonderful event. TEAM ARIZONA organized its efforts to  continue the tradition and participated in the 2009 5K Walk/5k Run/10k Run in  Phoenix, AZ and for the second year in a row was the highest grossing  fundraising team.<br /><br />
    From 2007 to  2011, the CCC – TEAM ARIZONA also coordinated a community-wide toy collection  to benefit the pediatric patients of the <a href="http://www.mihs.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Maricopa County Medical Center</strong></a>. TEAM ARIZONA  delivered several truckloads full of toys to the neediest of patients during  the holidays and truly demonstrated that members of the Call Center industry  really do care.<br /><br />
    In 2009-2011,  the CCC – TEAM ARIZONA conducted a Diaper &amp; Underwear Drive to help  families seeking shelter at the<a href="http://www.sojournercenter.org/go2/" target="_blank"> <strong>Sojourner  Center</strong></a> in Phoenix, Arizona. TEAM ARIZONA helped collect  more than 2000 undergarments and diapers each year for the Sojourner Center. </p>

                <h4><strong>Team Synovation</strong></h4>
                <div class="box">
<p>In addition to Synergy’s support of CALL CENTERS CARE initiatives, at  each of our  call center locations  throughout the US, team members join together in the true spirit of Synovation  (The Power of Team + Innovation) to organize and raise funds for local charities  and to support fellow employees in times of need. Synergy’s Synovation Teams  have donated time and resources in support of various charities and  organizations and have collected thousands of dollars to provide relief to  catastrophe victims. Local fundraising has occurred for school supplies, local  shelters, food drives, building playgrounds and collecting clothing, as well as  organized fund raisers to help fellow employees who have gone through extreme  hardship including illness, death of a loved one, fires, flood and other  personal tragedy.<br/>
<br/>
On a national level, Synergy has organized support for Tsunami Victims,  Hurricane Katrina victims, Haiti disaster relief and our ongoing partnership with <a href="http://www.notmykid.org/" target="_blank" class="no_float"><u>notmykid.org</u></a> where our commitment of resources and funding helps to provide the  operational support needed for this non profit to continue its mission of  providing behavioral risk education to parents to address the problems of drug  and alcohol abuse, eating disorders and suicide amongst teens and adolescents.</p>
